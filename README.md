S3 Multiscreen
==============

S3 Multiscreen is a Java application which hosts a webpage which displays a random collection of videos pulled from an S3 bucket.

The frontend is based on Video.js as a player.

Tested & proved to work on IOS, Android, PC, Mac etc...

The multiscreen functionaity appears to be limited by the amount of players that most browsers will render concurrently.

The /random.html page works really well though...
